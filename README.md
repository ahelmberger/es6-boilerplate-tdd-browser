# es6-boilerplate-tdd-browser

This template provides infrastructure to execute tests with Jasmine inside the browser in an ECMAScript 6 environment.

## How to use

* Start a webserver in the root directory
* Load `index.html` in your browser
* Start writing tests in in `test.js`

## Further information

This template uses the [ES6 Module Loader Polyfill](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader) to load modules, as well as [6to5](https://6to5.org/) to transpile ECMAScript 6 code to ECMAScript 5 inside the browser.

For a complete overview into ECMAScript 6 modules see [this post by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html). He also has very good introductions into the [new language features in ECMAScript 6](http://www.2ality.com/search/label/esnext).
